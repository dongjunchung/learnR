Resources to learn R

# General R:
- Collection of introductory documents can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html

# Visualization:
- ggplot2 is the most popular and cutting edge visualization tool: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/
- plotly is the even more cutting edge visualization tool that allows dynamic and interactive visualization: https://plotly.com/r/

# Bulk RNA-seq data analysis:
- edgeR and DESeq2 are the most popular analysis methods for bulk RNA-seq.
- edgeR: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf
- DESeq2: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html

# Single cell RNA-seq data analysis:
- Seurat and monocle are the most popular methods for visualization/clustering and pseudotime analyses, respectively, using single-cell RNA-seq data.  
- Seurat: https://satijalab.org/seurat/
- Monocle: http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/
- Bioconductor workflow: 

# TCR-seq data analysis:
- TCR-seq data analysis tools are still under development in my impression. tcR has been most popular for a while and immunarch is an emerging popular tool.
- immunarch: https://immunarch.com/
- tcR: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcR/vignettes/tcrvignette.html
